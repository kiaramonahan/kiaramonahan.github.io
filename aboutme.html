    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>As a data scientist with a strong foundation in programming, machine learning, and data analysis, I‚Äôm passionate about using data to drive meaningful insights and solutions. My background includes several years of research experience, where I honed my skills in data collection, statistical analysis, and project management, and now, with a Master's in Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley (expected Dec. 2024), I‚Äôve shifted my focus to leveraging data science to solve real-world challenges. I‚Äôve developed predictive models, built data workflows, and created visualizations to make complex data accessible and actionable. 
<br><br>
My goal is to use data science to make a positive impact, whether it‚Äôs through advancing research, improving systems, or supporting initiatives that benefit communities and the environment.
<br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, taking care of my aquarium, visiting parks, and traveling.

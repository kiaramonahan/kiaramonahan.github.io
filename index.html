          <h2>CoralSense</h2>
          <p>This project aims to predict future coral reef health globally using machine learning and time series models with the goal to aid conservationists, governments, and raise public awareness. Researched and integrated over 6 environmental, socio-economic, and geospatial datasets, including satellite imagery, utilizing SQL, GeoPandas, and Pandas in Python. Developed a map interface with JavaScript and HTML to display model predictions, and used React for back-end website creation. Employed AWS for both model training and website hosting.</p>

          <h2>Med-Abrev-Mystery</h2>
          <p>Developed a novel BERT-based model structure that extracts and pools hidden state embeddings from specific abbreviation locations within clinical text. Fine-tuned BERT models (Base BERT Cased and MS BERT) on the MeDAL dataset, which contains over 5,800 medical abbreviations and their expansions, to disambiguate abbreviations in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Applied the fine-tuned models to mortality and diagnosis prediction tasks using the MIMIC-III dataset. Results demonstrated modest performance improvements, showcasing the potential for further exploration of BERT fine-tuning in clinical NLP applications.</p>

          <h2>Predicting Flight Delays for Consumers</h2>
          <p>Developed time series predictive pipelines using large datasets and distributed frameworks on the Databricks platform to enhance airline customer experience by forecasting flight delays with U.S. Department of Transportation and NOAA data. Highly predictive new features were created, including a PageRank feature. The project employed grid searches to optimize logistic regression and neural network models in PySpark.</p>

          <h2>Cystic Fibrosis Theratyping: Matching Mutations to Medications</h2>
          <p>Although this is a biomedical research project, it highlights my project management skills as I planned and conducted the project from start to finish. In addition, most of my time on this project was spent analyzing and visualizing data. The goal of this project was to match cystic fibrosis patients with rare mutations to effective medications by "testing out" CFTR modulators on cultures of the patients' tissue samples. This was a part of my work at the UCSF Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute.</p>

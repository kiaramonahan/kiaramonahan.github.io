          <h2>CoralSense</h2>
          <p>I led this end-to-end project to model global coral reef health, addressing the urgent threat of reef degradation due to climate change, pollution, and overfishing. By integrating six diverse datasets‚Äîincluding satellite imagery, socioeconomic data, and marine biodiversity indicators‚Äîusing Python (SQL, GeoPandas, Pandas), I engineered features and prepared data for advanced analysis. I designed and built a dynamic interactive map with Mapbox, React, JavaScript, and HTML to visualize predictions and enable scenario testing. Through robust machine learning models testing, our best random forest model achieved an F1 score of 0.84 in predicting severe coral bleaching, providing actionable insights to aid conservation and policymaking.

          <h2>Exploring Tumor Microenvironment Interactions: Tools and Workflows for ER+ Breast Cancer</h2>
          <p>Our project aims to develop a streamlined workflow to implement existing cell-cell communication (CCC) inference methods on single-cell RNA-seq data. We use data from ER+ breast cancer tissues specifically examining interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts to model these analyses and develop our workflows. We have developed streamlined workflows for these analyses that can be applied to other datasets, cell types, and conditions of interest. By altering a YAML, users will be able to easily conduct complete analyses and generate HTML output files using our .rmd files. This simplifies the analysis process and will allow researchers to spend less time learning, writing, and editing code.

          <h2>Med-Abrev-Mystery</h2>
          <p>This project employs a novel BERT-based model structure that extracts and pools hidden state embeddings from specific abbreviation locations within clinical text. We fine-tuned BERT models (Base BERT Cased and MS BERT) on the MeDAL dataset, which contains over 5,800 medical abbreviations and their expansions, to disambiguate abbreviations in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Then, we applied the fine-tuned models to mortality and diagnosis prediction tasks using the MIMIC-III dataset. Results demonstrated modest performance improvements, showcasing the potential for further exploration of BERT fine-tuning in clinical NLP applications.</p>

          <h2>Predicting Flight Delays for Consumers</h2>
          <p>In this project, we developed time series predictive pipelines using large datasets and distributed frameworks on the Databricks platform to enhance airline customer experience by forecasting flight delays with U.S. Department of Transportation and NOAA data. Highly predictive new features were created, including a PageRank feature. The project employed grid searches to optimize logistic regression and neural network models in PySpark.</p>

          <h2>Cystic Fibrosis Theratyping: Matching Mutations to Medications</h2>
          <p>Although this is a biomedical research project, it highlights my project management skills as I planned and conducted the project from start to finish. In addition, most of my time on this project was spent analyzing and visualizing data. The goal of this project was to match cystic fibrosis patients with rare mutations to effective medications by "testing out" CFTR modulators on cultures of the patients' tissue samples. This was a part of my work at the UCSF Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute.</p>

Out of my own curiosity, I created a visual that walks you through more than the simple country rankings. This project involved combining and cleaning several datasets in Python with pandas.</p>

          <p>We build on previous research by using modern statistical methods to explore the relationship between the physicochemical makeup of wines and their taste profiles. We hypothesize that refined regression techniques can yield insights into the subtle interplay of factors that govern consumer preferences, thereby providing actionable guidance for winemakers and marketers alike.</p>

          <p>If you've ever wondered how trending sounds differ between countries, how audio features of popular songs are related to each other, or what musical characteristics your my favorite artist has, you've come to the right place. Our journey through Spotify's daily Top 200 Charts from 2017-2021 aims to answer those questions, and many more. We created visuals for this scrollytelling project in Tableau and created the site in HTML.</p>
